# Rightmove Scraper
This is a Python script to find and star my ideal properties/learn a bit about Selenium. Yes this would be easier and 
faster just making the requests directly but that wouldn't have been any fun.

## Requirements
- Ensure `chromedriver.exe` is on PATH or in same directory as `scraper.py`
- Starring properties requires a valid login. To achieve this, 
provide path to your user profile after logging in to the site and ticking 'remember me'. 
- Edit code to match your preferences
